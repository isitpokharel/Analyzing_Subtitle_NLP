1
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,854
I'm not a Christian. I'm not an atheist.

2
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:59,274
I'm not Jewish. I'm not Muslim.

3
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:03,112
My religion and what I believe in

4
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:07,950
is called the Constitution
of the United States of America.

5
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,220
- Hang on.
- Did you get that?

6
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,848
- And let me open these up.
- Hmm?

7
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,261
Okay, go ahead.

8
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,932
If I'm not religious enough for you,
don't vote for me.

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,062
If I’m not experienced enough for you...

10
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,857
don't vote for me.

11
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,358
Uh...

12
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,906
You know what? Don't vote for me.
Don't. Don't do it.

13
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,796
Whatever you do, don't vote for me.

14
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,384
- How's that?
- Okay.

15
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,286
- Okay.
- We got it. Thanks.

16
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,790
Can we get the monitors up a little?

17
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,706
I'd like the governor to
be able to hear himself.

18
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,957
- You got it.
- Okay.

19
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,543
Also... are we gonna put risers
under these podiums

20
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,879
like we discussed in the preconditions?

21
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,532
No, I know. We didn't get
the specs till last night.

22
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,535
They're making something
to slide right under that.

23
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,839
Okay. Thank you.

24
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:52,133
It's just they're a few inches short, so it
makes it hard for him to read his notes.

25
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:53,387
Okay.

26
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,265
Gentlemen, thank you.
And I'll see you in a few hours.

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,170
Didn't know the governor had
trouble reading his notes.

28
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:58,610
Why doesn't he wear glasses?

29
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,784
No, he doesn't. Just Pullman is 5'8".
He's gonna look like a hobbit.

30
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,664
I like Mike! I like Mike!

31
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,795
Well, it all comes down to this.

32
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,881
We are one week away
from the Ohio primary.

33
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,343
Two democrats on left standing.
Senator Pullman of Arkansas

34
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,887
trailing Governor Morris of Pennsylvania.

35
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:38,475
Governor Morris has mounted
a sizable lead, with 2047 delegates,

36
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:41,770
winning New Hampshire, California,
New York and Michigan.

37
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:46,358
But Senator Pullman, with 1302
delegates, is still in the hunt,

38
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,778
having won Florida and Tennessee
and Virginia and Missouri.

39
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:54,449
A win in Ohio could turn it all
around for the Arkansas senator.

40
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:55,967
One week from Tuesday,

41
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:00,706
the all-important 161 Ohio delegates
could be the deciding factor.

42
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:06,128
Once again, it is true,
as goes Ohio, so goes the nation.

43
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,839
Would you call yourself Christian?

44
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,148
How would that matter?

45
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,093
"Let me quote. I have no idea
what happens when we die.

46
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,430
Maybe nothing. Maybe it's like
before we were born." Unquote.

47
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,724
- You did write this governor.
- Let me be specific.

48
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,142
Please do.

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,103
l was raised Catholic.
l am not a practicing Catholic.

50
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,230
And I have no idea what
happens after we die.

51
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,375
If the senator does, maybe he should
be president. I'll vote for him.

52
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,403
ls that your idea of being specific?

53
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,239
- Let me be more specific.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,617
I am not a Christian or an atheist.
I'm not Jewish or Muslim.

55
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,411
What I believe, my religion,

56
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,581
is written on a piece of paper
called The Constitution.

57
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,167
Meaning that I will defend,
until my dying breath, your right

58
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:49,038
to worship whatever god you believe in,
as long as it doesn't hurt others.

59
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,273
I believe we should be judged as a country,

60
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,926
by how we take care of the people
who cannot take care of themselves.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,200
That's my religion.

62
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,264
If you think I'm not religious enough,
don't vote for me.

63
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,517
If you think I'm not experienced enough,
or tall enough, don't vote for me.

64
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,561
Because I can't change
that to get elected.

65
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,390
l just wanted you to say out loud if you
believe in the teachings of the Bible.

66
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,568
ls this a Democratic primary
or a general election?

67
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:14,946
Well governor, whoever wins this
contest will be running for president.

68
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,949
And if you think that
these questions won't be central

69
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,119
in a general election,
then you are living in fantasy land.

70
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,913
I'm simply pointing to the obvious.

71
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,791
We are running for president
of the United States,

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,417
not student council president.

73
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,322
- Double?
- Yeah, double.

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,783
Fucking national security.

75
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,493
- Out of the park.
- Home run.

76
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:04,204
The alumni of Miami University of Ohio

77
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,790
would like to thank you
for attending tonight's debate

78
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,961
and ask you to please remain in your seats
until the candidates have left the stage.

79
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,270
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,506
You know, I'm trying to remember
if the Democrats

81
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,967
have ever nominated an atheist before.

82
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,678
Well, we know they've
nominated a jackass before.

83
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,890
Oh, must have been you
that did that prep work, Stephen.

84
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:26,935
Paul's not that clever.
You've always had the brain' stuff.

85
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,438
But me, I've had the balls.

86
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,774
Well, it looks like you've
got some brains now too.

87
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,361
Be careful. I just might
have to steal him from you.

88
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,737
Hm.

89
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,575
What a prick.

90
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:50,500
# We'll meet again #

91
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,589
# Don't know where. Don't know when #

92
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,886
# But I know we'll meet again #

93
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:06,641
# Some sunny day, oh #

94
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,894
So Paul, tell me something I don't know.

95
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,063
Tell me what's going
to happen on the 15th.

96
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:15,150
- Oh, God.
- What?

97
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:21,072
- What do you think, Stevie?
- I think it's ours for the taking. You?

98
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,409
- Yeah. Ben?
- Yeah, we'll win.

99
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,829
- What do you think, Ida?
- I'm asking you.

100
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,873
Oh, you tell me, I'll tell you.

101
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:34,252
If I had to say, I'd say it'll be
close, but you'll eke it out.

102
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,046
"Eke"?

103
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,423
You see?
She's trying to get under my skin.

104
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,926
- So, what's gonna happen?
- Us by nine.

105
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:44,012
So you're certain you're gonna win here?

106
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,890
- Certain, no. Confident, yeah.
- You just said you'll win by nine.

107
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:49,968
And I think that we will. I'm not
gonna tell you it's a sure thing.

108
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,937
If fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his
horn on election day, and get his

109
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,393
Four Horsemen to rig the ballot boxes
for Pullman, and it wouldn't surprise me.

110
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,402
Six presidentials I've done
and I've never felt this good.

111
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,781
But I'm not gonna sit here and say,
"Yeah, hey, we'll win Ohio."

112
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,157
Not a chance.

113
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:07,369
In the last 30 years,
73 Democrats have run for president.

114
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:08,870
How many have won? Three.

115
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,958
That means 70 guys ran who thought
they had a chance, and they all lost.

116
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,919
So you're saying there's a
good chance you won't win.

117
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:17,170
Don't twist my words, Ida.

118
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:20,215
What I'm saying is I'm not
gonna promise you we'll win.

119
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,576
But he was decorated by Bush Senior
from the first Gulf War,

120
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,069
he protested the second,

121
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,639
he left his state with a balanced budget
and the fourth-highest education rate.

122
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,685
The Republicans have no one out there
that can touch this guy.

123
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:37,440
For this moment, this election,
this primary, is the presidential.

124
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,194
And that, Ida, is the state of the union.

125
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,988
And on that note...

126
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,908
I'm gonna take a shit.

127
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,579
- So, Stephen.
- So, Ida.

128
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,832
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
- Ida, Ida, Ida.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,875
- Paul's going to the airport.
- Yeah.

130
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,753
- He's getting on a plane.
- That's what you do going at airport, yeah.

131
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,505
Where's that plane going?

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,966
Okay.

133
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:06,636
- I'll give you three guesses.
- He's not going back to headquarters.

134
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,597
- Correct.
- He's not going to Texas.

135
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,974
No need. We're gonna split Texas.
So it's a wash.

136
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,851
What if I said North Carolina?

137
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,687
- Is that your guess?
- He's going to North Carolina.

138
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,524
- I can neither confirm nor deny that.
- I knew it. Now tell me why.

139
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,111
- I cannot do that.
- Ugh. I hate you.

140
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,447
- You love me.
- I love Paul. You, I hate.

141
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,158
You love him
because he gives you the scoops.

142
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:30,827
- Sexual favors.
- You're engaged.

143
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,539
If it meant a good scoop,
my fiance would understand.

144
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,001
You really buy into all this crap.

145
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,712
All this "take back the country" nonsense.

146
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,382
Ida, I'm not naive, okay?
I've worked on more campaigns

147
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,093
than most people have
by the time they're 40.

148
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:49,804
I'm telling you, this is the one.

149
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:53,933
- You really have drunk the Kool-Aid.
- I have drunk it. It's delicious.

150
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:57,354
Look, I don't care if he happens
to be leading in the polls

151
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,065
and I don't care if he happens
to have all the right tools.

152
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,442
The truth is, he's the only one

153
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,820
that's gonna actually make a
difference in the people's lives.

154
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,572
Even the people that hate him.

155
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,366
If Mike Morris is president,

156
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,160
it says more about us
than it does about him.

157
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:16,081
I don't give a fuck, if he can win.
He has to win.

158
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,918
Or what? What?
The world's gonna fall apart?

159
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,673
It won't matter, not one bit,

160
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,258
to the everyday lives
or the everyday fuckers

161
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,261
who get up, and work, and eat, and sleep,

162
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,763
go back to work again.

163
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,100
You know, if your boy wins,
you get a job in the White House.

164
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,728
He loses, you're back at a
consulting firm on the K Street.

165
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,140
That's it.

166
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:45,210
You used to know that before you
got all goosebumpy about this guy.

167
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,196
Mike Morris is a politician.

168
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,116
He's a nice guy. They're all nice guys.

169
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,077
He will let you down, sooner or later.

170
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,124
# 'Scuse me #

171
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,293
# While I #

172
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,461
# Disappear #

173
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,891
- This is off-off-off the record.
- What?

174
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,643
- Franklin Thompson.
- Seriously?

175
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,855
Off the record. The only people who know
are the governor, Stephen and me.

176
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,064
My lips are sealed.

177
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,650
Tomorrow I have a meeting
at Thompson's house.

178
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,653
- He's going to endorse?
- After I'm done talking to him.

179
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,822
That's huge.

180
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,701
More than huge.
He has 356 pledged delegates.

181
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:37,662
They all travel with him.
Puts us over the top.

182
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,498
He said publicly he's not
going to endorse anybody.

183
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,543
Yeah well, that's what they all say
until you get them alone in a room.

184
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,546
- So this is for real.
- Yep.

185
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,231
Just about in the bag.

186
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,383
When are you going to announce?

187
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,343
Nope, that's all you get for now.

188
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:58,183
Okay, listen up.
These are your new cell phones.

189
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,451
Shelly's pre-programmed
your numbers. Thank you Shelly.

190
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,412
No personal calls, Kevin.

191
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,190
If you lose them,
the DNC will come to your house.

192
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,026
- New cell phone. Give me your old one.
- I'll give you later.

193
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,361
l gotta believe we can do it.

194
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,548
We have enemies. We have to understand
why our enemies are our enemies

195
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:16,868
and see if there's something we can do
about that, besides just using force.

196
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,164
As we know from history, the answer
to extremism can't be extremism.

197
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:22,473
Fucking kill me.

198
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,235
Whoever throws their hat in.
Whoever decides...

199
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,598
Where did we get this?

200
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,213
Some town-hall meeting
in Pennsylvania before the announce.

201
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,778
Thank God it wasn't overseas.
Just get rid of it.

202
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,730
Hey, what I mean, if it plays to his base,
why would this bother us?

203
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,110
Are you fucking stoned?

204
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,367
This is the exact same piece
the Republicans are gonna run

205
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,556
against him in the general.
We don't need to brag about it.

206
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,059
Hi, I'm Neville Chamberlain.
I'd like to be your commander in chief.

207
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,577
Then if it's gonna come out anyway...

208
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:46,731
Then it's gonna come out, but it's not
gonna come out paid for by us, pal.

209
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,576
You think there's any truth to Pullman

210
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,253
having investments in a
diamond mine in Liberia?

211
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,823
Still checking on it, but we got it
from a blog, so who the fuck...

212
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,117
I don't care if it's true.
I just wanna hear him denying it.

213
00:12:58,285 --> 00:12:59,410
If it is true, great. Find out.

214
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,539
But if not, let them spend
the day telling the Post

215
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,875
that he doesn't own
a diamond mine in Liberia.

216
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,012
- Win-win.
- Okay.

217
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,081
We gotta counter this Christian shit
we took from him last night

218
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,250
- Got it.
- I need the new 30 and 60-second spots.

219
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,804
We can show him in the
staff meeting this afternoon, so...

220
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,689
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:31,276
Ben wanted me to get you to sign off
on this before the staff meeting.

222
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,279
Okay. Thank you,
I've been waiting for this.

223
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,993
Anything interesting?

224
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,871
This is some white paper
I have to hand out tonight.

225
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,956
What's "white paper"?

226
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,585
Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research,

227
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:51,129
we feed it to the press,
and we see what sticks.

228
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,506
What kind of negative shit?

229
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,467
- You'll read the paper tomorrow.
- Which paper?

230
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:00,638
- Any. Any paper.
- So it's something big?

231
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,266
I wish it was something bigger.

232
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,810
It's just these transportation numbers.

233
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,313
I'm gonna have to spin pretty hard
to make it stick.

234
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,816
- That's what you're good at, right?
- I guess.

235
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,151
Tell him it's fine.

236
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:17,280
- Did you get your new phone?
- Mm-hm.

237
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,908
It's really exciting, isn't it?

238
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,453
What are you, a Bearcat?

239
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,246
Am I a what?

240
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,332
Cincinnati Bearcat?

241
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,127
Oh, no. I'm not from here.

242
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,630
I worked with you in Iowa, actually.

243
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,257
Oh.

244
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,051
That's right.

245
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,844
But you changed something.

246
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,513
- My hair?
- You changed your hair.

247
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,183
No.

248
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,852
Oh. I see.

249
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,355
Bet you I look like a real
dumb-ass right now, huh?

250
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,023
No, not at all.

251
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,693
You're the big man on campus.
I'm just a lowly intern.

252
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,070
Oh, it's not like that.

253
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,957
You get to stay at the Millennium.

254
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,691
OK? They put us in a motel
on the other side of the river.

255
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,905
You're right. I am the big man on campus.

256
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:06,207
- Now you're starting to see.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,170
- We do have a better bar, though.
- I've heard that.

258
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,877
You should come by one night.
Have a drink with the worker bees.

259
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,547
I might do that. I might do that.
What's a good night?

260
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,342
- Tonight's good.
- Tonight? Tuesday night?

261
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,262
- Yeah. It's quiet.
- Quiet's good.

262
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,891
Well, you have my number.

263
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,686
I do?

264
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:31,729
It's programmed right
there in your phone.

265
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,564
Aha.

266
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,694
- Under "Mary."
- I know your name's Mary.

267
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:41,906
My name is Molly.

268
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,201
Yep.

269
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,877
That's what I'm hearing.

270
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:58,589
Since Super Tuesday, all of a
sudden, I'm a very popular guy.

271
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,093
What are your polls telling you?

272
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,513
That Pullman's negatives
are high. Mid 40s.

273
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,934
Senator, we have an open
seat in the White House.

274
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:14,230
The Republicans have dick.
They're disorganized.

275
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:18,401
They can't find a nominee
that's not a world-class fuck-up.

276
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,778
They look like Democrats.

277
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,115
No Republican's gonna
show up to vote for their guy.

278
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,745
But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod,
they will show up to vote against him.

279
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:31,998
And you think they won't for your guy.
You think Morris gets the independents.

280
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,501
I sure do. Senator, I'm a bit confused.

281
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,255
We need your delegates.

282
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,966
We need you.

283
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,302
Your fund-raising.

284
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,471
And I guess

285
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,600
it was my understanding
that your endorsement

286
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:55,188
a week before Ohio would win this for us.

287
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,321
- Thank you.
- Estella.

288
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,199
Hand me that ice bucket.

289
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,663
- Is this Paul, or is this you?
- Paul knows and Paul agrees.

290
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,333
Ben, where's my op-ed piece
on national service?

291
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,228
- It's easier for me to work off of that.
- Got it right here.

292
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,065
Give me a hard copy, I
hate those fucking things.

293
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,499
Can we print it out?

294
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,508
- Molly, can you grab it a print for me?
- Yeah, one second.

295
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,846
- So if you wanna change or refresh...
- Just give me a second, will you?

296
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,522
Your national service isn't polling
the same as the rest of your policy.

297
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,275
I don't give a shit about the polling, Stephen.
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

298
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:43,444
This is your good-cop,
bad-cop act with Paul.

299
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,029
Good-cop, good-cop.

300
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,240
I'm not changing it.

301
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,129
Here we go.

302
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,463
All right, let's see.

303
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,384
It says we're gonna help people
get an education,

304
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,762
we're gonna create national unity,
we're gonna teach young people a trade,

305
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,473
and we're gonna to get them out of debt
for their college loans.

306
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,351
- Now, where does that fail?
- All of that's exactly right, governor.

307
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,728
Just, if you're gonna do it, do it.

308
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,064
Make it mandatory, not voluntary.

309
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,276
- Now, that'll poll well.
- Mandatory.

310
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:26,070
Everybody who turns 18
or graduates high school

311
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,364
gives two years of service
to his or her country.

312
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:32,577
It can be in the military, Peace Corps,
planting fucking trees, I don't care.

313
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,496
For that, your college education
is paid for, period.

314
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:36,873
We do all of that right here.

315
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,002
No, sir, you don't, not all the way.
Do it all the way. Mandatory.

316
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,628
- Paul likes this?
- Mm-hm.

317
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,922
You're my brain trust.

318
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,482
The beauty of it is that everybody
who's over the age of 18

319
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,734
or past the age of
eligibility will be for it.

320
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,554
- Why not?
- And all of the others...

321
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,264
Can't vote.

322
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,809
Too young.

323
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,940
Too bad.

324
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,488
You can't lose.

325
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,618
- Uh, Stephen?
- Mm?

326
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,746
You have a call on Line 3. It's your dad.

327
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,539
Okay.

328
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,167
You and Ben work it in this stump speech.

329
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:24,128
and you'll get me a hard copy
and I'll write it in my own words.

330
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,757
- Don't forget you have Charlie Rose at 6.
- Right. Yeah. Why am I doing him?

331
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,926
It's long-form. He's flying in.

332
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,135
Paul going?

333
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,930
Paul won't be in,
but Ben and I will take you.

334
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,017
Just don't tell me someone's died.

335
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,310
Hey, Steve.

336
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,270
- Who is this?
- Tom Duffy.

337
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,688
Sorry about the dad bit.

338
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:45,650
Uh... I just figured you wouldn't
want my name called out

339
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,152
at a Morris campaign office.

340
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,655
- What do you want?
- You got a couple minutes?

341
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,407
- I'd like to sit down with you.
- What for?

342
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,117
Well, I think it's important.

343
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:58,496
Well, if it's important, don't you think
you should be calling Paul?

344
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,164
I'm calling you.

345
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,254
This is on the up-and-up.
Steve, give me five minutes.

346
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:09,006
- I can't be talking to you.
- I hear you.

347
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,564
But, if you got five minutes,

348
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,945
I'm gonna be at the Head First sport
bar for the next couple of hours.

349
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,536
I can't, Tom.

350
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:19,225
There won't be anybody there. Okay?

351
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,353
You get a chance,
there's something I wanna show you.

352
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,958
Paul, call me back. It's important.

353
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,052
You're working for the wrong man.

354
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,362
You are working for the wrong man.

355
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,307
Oh, on the contrary, you are the
one working for the wrong man.

356
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,726
And you got something the
other guys don't have.

357
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,519
- Yeah?
- Yeah, what is it exactly?

358
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:05,271
"Charm" is not the right word.

359
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,107
- It is the right word.
- No, it's more than that.

360
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,568
You exude something. You draw people in.

361
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:15,406
All the reporters love you.
Even the ones that hate you, love you.

362
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,493
Cuz you play them like the pieces on a
chessboard and make it look effortless.

363
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,163
And we both know how hard it is

364
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:25,833
constantly being on guard,
weighing every word, every move.

365
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:31,088
But from the outside,
you make it look easy.

366
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,590
People are scared of you.

367
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,010
Cuz they don't understand how you do it,
and they love you for it.

368
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,679
And that is the most valuable
thing in this business.

369
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:43,851
The ability to win people's respect by
making them mistake their fear for love.

370
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,603
You can guess what I'm gonna say next.

371
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,689
- I don't think that I can.
- I want you to work for us.

372
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,777
- What, are you kidding?
- No, not in the least.

373
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,114
- You're gonna lose Ohio.
- I am not.

374
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,576
Oh, you're sitting on about
a six percent lead in both polls.

375
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,745
Six percent of all Democrats polled.

376
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:05,122
- Eight.
- No, six. Doesn't matter.

377
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,958
Ohio is an open primary, right?

378
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,379
Independents and Republicans get the vote
on the Democratic candidate.

379
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,255
Do you think they like your guy?

380
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:18,302
- A pro-choice tax-and-spend liberal?
- No. Fuck, no. No, they hate him.

381
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,805
They think they can beat my guy.

382
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,140
But they're very worried about yours.

383
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,480
So starting tomorrow morning,
you're gonna see a fucking blitz.

384
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,149
Limbaugh, Hannity,
all those right-wing blogs

385
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,610
are starting a get-out-the-vote campaign.

386
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:36,112
It's started already.

387
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,657
Every fuckin' conservative in Ohio
is gonna line up around the block

388
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,785
to punch my guy's ticket,
and that's just one step.

389
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:46,288
Ohio's gone. Polls don't mean shit.

390
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:48,165
Tomorrow morning everybody's gonna know.

391
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,253
And that's why I want you to handle the
fallout that we'll have in the press.

392
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,674
Oh, and we got Thompson in the bag too.

393
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,385
I know for a fact that
you don't have Thompson.

394
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:01,637
No, we promised him secretary of state.

395
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:05,274
Ohio is over. It has been over for weeks.

396
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,154
And now with Thompson's delegates? Huh.

397
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:13,958
I'm thinking down the road here, man.
That is why I want you.

398
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,007
- I can't do it.
- Bring you straight to the top.

399
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,353
I can't do it.

400
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,070
All right. I don't need an
answer right this moment.

401
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,700
- Look, I've played dirty. All right?
- I'm sorry to hear it.

402
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,320
But I don't have to play dirty anymore.
You know why? I got Morris.

403
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,630
No, no, none of this is about
the democratic process, Steve.

404
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,343
It's about getting your guy off.

405
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,127
- This is the shit Republicans pull.
- Yeah, you know what?

406
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:37,965
This is the kind of shit that the Republicans pull,
and it's about time we learned from them.

407
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:42,052
They're meaner, they're tougher,
they're more disciplined than we are.

408
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,096
I've been in this business 25 years.

409
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,599
and I've seen way too many
Democrats bite the dust

410
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:50,561
because they wouldn't get down in
the mud with the fucking elephants.

411
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,336
Paul's my friend.

412
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,042
You wanna work for the friend or do
you wanna work for the president?

413
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,451
Think about it. You got my number.

414
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,205
Paul.

415
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:11,874
Hey, they don't make quaaludes
anymore, do they?

416
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:15,503
Not that I'm aware of.
What's going on with Thompson?

417
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,797
Uh, he wants something, but...

418
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,760
We'll be fine. What was so important?

419
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,472
Nothing. Figured it out.

420
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,356
All right.
I'll be on my cell if you need me.

421
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,775
I fly to D.C. tomorrow,
back tomorrow night.

422
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,528
Okay. I'll work on the quaaludes.

423
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,530
Good man.

424
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,875
Check the blogs and see if there's
any chatter, would you?

425
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:56,961
- Chatter? What kind of chatter?
- I don't know.

426
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,464
- Just see what they're talking about.
- Stevie, you still single?

427
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,925
I'm married to the campaign, governor.

428
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,469
He's married to the campaign.
Good answer.

429
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,304
Wall Street Journal has our
numbers holding steady.

430
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,974
- Pullman dropped a point.
- Really, when did they do that?

431
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,555
Checking now.

432
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:14,469
Governor, the Wall Street Journal numbers
are running Pullman down a point.

433
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,780
Uh... we're moving
in the right direction.

434
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,315
Ben, are you still single?

435
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,527
- Married to the campaign, governor.
- Crack team.

436
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:25,155
Make sure Charlie Rose has those
numbers before he goes on.

437
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,949
I'm on it.

438
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,619
Get a copy of the show
before we leave too.

439
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,497
Is it a difficult decision?
I have to believe it is.

440
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,873
Would I do it? No.

441
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,501
But I can't see myself or anyone,
certainly not a government,

442
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:39,974
telling a woman what she
should do with her body.

443
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,505
So, you would appoint a judge?

444
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:46,385
I would consider it arrogant to judge
anyone until I've walked in their shoes.

445
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:48,512
- But you're against the death penalty?
- Mmhmm.

446
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,006
Because of what it says
about us as a society.

447
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:53,225
Suppose, governor, it was your wife.

448
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:55,561
And she was murdered, what would I do?

449
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:57,730
It gets more complicated
when it's personal.

450
00:25:57,897 --> 00:26:01,150
Sure. Well, if I could get to him,

451
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,861
uh, I would find a way to kill him.

452
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,281
So you, you, governor,
would impose a death penalty.

453
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:11,118
No, I would commit a crime
for which I would happily go to jail.

454
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,704
Then why not let society do that?

455
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,957
Because society has to be
better than the individual.

456
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,126
If I were to do that, I would be wrong.

457
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,436
What about guns?

458
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:21,879
Isn't it time for a commercial?

459
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,740
This is public television.
We don't have any commercials.

460
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,150
That's unfortunate.

461
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,469
Where did you go after Iowa?

462
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,512
California. For Super Tuesday.

463
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,222
Oh.

464
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,476
- I had to go to New York.
- I know.

465
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:38,395
You guys needed a lot
more help over there.

466
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,022
Yeah.

467
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,402
So why politics?

468
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,363
Because the pay is so good, obviously.

469
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:52,576
It seems like a very odd fit.

470
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,079
My dad is Jack Stearns.

471
00:26:57,957 --> 00:27:01,669
- Oh, he's a good guy.
- He's an asshole.

472
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,379
But he's your boss.

473
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,131
He's not my boss.

474
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:09,718
He's the head of the DNC.

475
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:12,262
You don't work for the
Democratic National Committee?

476
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,890
I work for Paul. Paul works for Morris.

477
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:18,894
And if Morris wins,
he's gonna be your dad's boss.

478
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:20,771
Don't tell my dad that.

479
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,774
Don't tell your dad a lot of things.

480
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,734
Never.

481
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:31,532
What time you gotta work tomorrow?

482
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,659
Nine A.M.

483
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,454
I'm showing the new interns
how to robocall.

484
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,750
It's because I'm the experienced
intern, you see?

485
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,670
I see.

486
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:48,465
How old are you?

487
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,094
How old do you think I am?

488
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,139
Thirty.

489
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:59,309
- You think I'm 30?
- Sorry. How old are you?

490
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,186
Thirty.

491
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,359
How old are you?

492
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,195
How old do you think I am?

493
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,449
Twenty-one?

494
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:15,659
- Twenty.
- Yep.

495
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,704
That's young.

496
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,668
Is that too young to fuck a 30-year-old?

497
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:29,339
Well...

498
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,218
You see, the laws are different
in different states.

499
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:37,473
Here, at your hotel here in Kentucky,
it's frowned upon.

500
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,016
Oh.

501
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,518
But, if we go across the bridge into Ohio

502
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,737
Where your hotel is.

503
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:47,191
Yeah, surprisingly, they're very lax
about their child-endangerment laws.

504
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,861
- Do you have a car? I don't drive.
- I took a cab.

505
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,703
I have the keys to the campaign bus.

506
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,374
In fairness this has been tried before.

507
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,568
Operation Chaos, as Russ Limbaugh
called it, where Republicans

508
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,791
voted for a Democrat they thought they
could beat in the general election.

509
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,343
We asked Senator Pullman's
campaign manager

510
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:17,387
if he's happy getting the votes
of right-wingers.

511
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,932
Is it decisive? No, of course not.

512
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,143
But look, we believe the polls
are within the margin of error

513
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:25,395
and that the senator will win Ohio.

514
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,106
Yeah, what time's Paul get in?

515
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:31,860
Shit. Who do we talk to about polling?

516
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:36,114
I gotta get some internal polling on the
independents and the fucking wing nuts.

517
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,574
Do you want me to go?

518
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,410
What's that guy's name
from the Wall Street Journal?

519
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,526
You sound busy. I should go.

520
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:45,173
Could you hold on a second, I'd like
to talk to you about something.

521
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,501
Adler, yeah. Get him on the line.

522
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,720
Nobody. The cleaning lady.

523
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,319
Get him on the line.

524
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,849
Tell him we're gonna take the
same position we've always said:

525
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,526
The race is a lot closer
than the polling.

526
00:29:57,846 --> 00:30:00,055
No, don't say that. Don't.

527
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:03,934
Just get him on the line and call me.
I'll take care of it. I'm sorry.

528
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,687
- Cleaning lady?
- Yeah.

529
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:09,648
You called me the cleaning lady.

530
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,010
You're not mad about that, are you?

531
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,795
- No, why would I be mad?
- Right.

532
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,488
l spoke with Jack Stearns.

533
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:17,990
Oh, hey. Look.

534
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,868
l know you're looking for
a reaction, but listen.

535
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:23,620
We have two great candidates
in a very tight race.

536
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,623
And at the end of the day,
the voters will decide

537
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,792
who best can represent this party.

538
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,836
I understand Jack, but
doesn't this kind disruption

539
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:33,797
take away from what you guys
wanna be pushing this year?

540
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,842
You're right. Your dad is an asshole.

541
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,996
- I'm gonna tell him you said that.
- Yeah, do that.

542
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,407
You wanted to talk to me about something?

543
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,894
Yeah, I just wanna be clear. I don't
want there to be any confusion.

544
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,313
I'm not gonna tell anybody
about last night.

545
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,123
That'd be great if we kept it between us.

546
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,941
- You know how people are.
- Yeah.

547
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,778
Really wouldn't look good
if you screwed an intern.

548
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,989
It's not like that.

549
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,992
It's not like I got drunk. I like you.

550
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,620
I just don't want there
to be any expectations.

551
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:08,165
- Steve, you don't have to say anything.
- All right.

552
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,667
I just don't want you
to think I'm a player.

553
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,253
You are kind of a player, but...

554
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,674
- I was being polite.
- Bullshit.

555
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,969
- You were trying to pick me up.
- No, I wasn't.

556
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,263
You were pretty obvious about it.

557
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,474
- I was?
- Yeah.

558
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:29,686
- I thought I was being smooth and subtle.
- No, you were pretty forward.

559
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,189
You were pretty forward
asking me to the bar.

560
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,360
Well, been trying to fuck you
for a while.

561
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:38,820
Wow.

562
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,074
- It's kind of slutty of me, huh?
- Not at all.

563
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:46,328
- I respect it in some strange way.
- Good.

564
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,657
You absolutely have no
idea how to tie a tie.

565
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,391
No, no, not a clue.

566
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,213
You're very mature.

567
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,049
For a teenager.

568
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,804
When are you coming back?

569
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:09,059
I'll be at the event a little late.
These cocksuckers, fucking dirty shit.

570
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,896
- What happened with Thompson?
- Nothing. Prick.

571
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,524
We had him all sewed up, motherfucker.

572
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,526
How bad is it?

573
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:24,074
I don't know. I just...
I'm running the numbers, Paul.

574
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,077
All right. I'll...
I'll be there in three hours.

575
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,454
l want hard numbers and a strategy.

576
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,082
Yeah, I'm on it. I gotta go.

577
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,636
You okay?

578
00:32:47,637 --> 00:32:49,866
Yeah. Just trying to
figure out our stops.

579
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,935
Think the weather might determine that.

580
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,729
If we get there.

581
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:55,897
We're gonna be fine.

582
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:58,400
We have to do it.
It's the right thing to do.

583
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:01,403
Nothing bad happens
when you're doing the right thing.

584
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:05,282
Is this your personal theory?
Because I can shoot holes in it.

585
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,076
Roberto Clemente on a
humanitarian flight.

586
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,288
Well, there's...
There's exceptions to every rule.

587
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,418
So how we doing?

588
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,089
- I think we're fine now.
- No, the campaign. How we doing?

589
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,468
Oh, great.

590
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:27,345
Stephen, you're not Paul.

591
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:31,433
I pay Paul to use the word "great."
I pay you to tell me the truth.

592
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,644
I think that we are solid.

593
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:37,856
Okay Paul.

594
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,652
Governor, there's a big difference
between Paul and me.

595
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,406
Paul only believes in winning,
so he'll do or say anything to win.

596
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:47,991
But you wouldn't.

597
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,535
I'll do or say anything
if I believe in it.

598
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:53,497
But I have to believe in the cause.

599
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,376
You'll make a lousy consultant
when you're out of this line of work.

600
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:02,297
Well, I won't be out of this line of
work as long as you're in it, sir.

601
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,674
So at best, you got eight years.

602
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:08,345
Then you end up at a nice
consultant firm off Farragut North,

603
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,098
making 750 grand a year,
eating at The Palm,

604
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:14,351
pimping out ex-senators to Saudi princes.

605
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:17,479
Pimping out ex-presidents.

606
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,439
Then I better win.

607
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,818
Yeah.

608
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,115
Now, I've been married for 11 years.

609
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,534
We have a normal marriage.

610
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,870
Which means when we disagree, she wins.

611
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,999
What we don't disagree on

612
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:41,128
is how we're gonna leave
this planet for our daughter.

613
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:44,673
Are we gonna leave it better off
or worse?

614
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:48,218
The richest people in this country
don't pay their fair share.

615
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,263
And when they're asked to,
they cry socialism.

616
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,391
They use phrases like
"redistribution of wealth."

617
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,268
Yeah.

618
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:59,855
That scares everybody,
and they all run and they hide.

619
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,065
For the record,

620
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,528
my campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth

621
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:09,239
to the richest Americans
by our government.

622
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:15,453
And I will run on that.

623
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:20,125
I didn't think it was true,
but I should've told you.

624
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,960
- Slow down.
- I'm sorry.

625
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,756
I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.

626
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,968
What?

627
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:33,346
You were on a plane and he called
me and asked if we could meet.

628
00:35:33,514 --> 00:35:37,058
I said, "Why?" He said
it was very important, so I did.

629
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:40,437
- And I should have fucking told you.
- Stop, stop. Let me get this straight.

630
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,940
- You met with Tom Duffy.
- Yeah.

631
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,343
What'd he want, Stephen?

632
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,970
The gist? He wants to hire me.

633
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,971
He wants me to jump ship
and come and work for him.

634
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,448
This is really fucking bad.

635
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,534
He told me they had poll numbers
that had Pullman ahead by 4.

636
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:57,370
And we're in big fuckin' trouble,
'cause he laid out their strategy.

637
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:00,957
Doing robocalls, traffic jams,
fake lit, and Thompson.

638
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,694
They offered Thompson secretary of state.

639
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,563
You know how you fight the war on terror?

640
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,465
You don't need their product anymore.

641
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,219
Their product is oil. Just don't
need it and they go away.

642
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:19,142
We don't have to bomb anyone.
We don't have to invade anyone.

643
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,980
If this is some kind of fucking
practical ... I mean...

644
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,567
My fucking blood pressure's going
through the goddamn roof right now.

645
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:28,985
Paul, I'm sorry.

646
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,864
Believe me.

647
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,001
I just didn't think it was true.

648
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:37,010
Oh, it doesn't matter what
you fucking thought!

649
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:39,621
It matters what you did!
It matters what you didn't do!

650
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,498
- You're right.
- Because if all this shit is true

651
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,700
I made a fucking ass out of
myself in Thompson's place,

652
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,702
and I gave away our game plan.

653
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,355
Please believe me. I honestly believed
you were gonna come back

654
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:50,674
and tell me we have Thompson in the bag.

655
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,008
I didn't see the point.

656
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,054
- It doesn't make it right, and I'm sorry.
- Let me think.

657
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,641
Let me think.

658
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,769
If I'm your president,
the first thing I'd put into motion

659
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:05,981
is 10 years from the day I take office,

660
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:10,360
no new car in America is run
on an internal combustion engine.

661
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,490
We will create hundreds
of thousands of new jobs,

662
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:18,702
we will start the next
technological revolution,

663
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,913
and we will lead the world again,
like we used to.

664
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,253
Get the governor right after
he finishes singing "Kumbaya"

665
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:31,131
and we give him everything we know.

666
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,676
- Who do you want?
- You, me and the governor. That's it.

667
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,095
- What's he have after?
- He has a fund-raiser.

668
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:38,405
Well, he'll be late.

669
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:41,391
We tell him if he doesn't
offer Thompson the Cabinet position,

670
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,560
he's not gonna get the nomination.

671
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,813
- Is he gonna go for it?
- I don't fucking know, Stephen!

672
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,316
Find us a room.

673
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:40,658
How real are the numbers?

674
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,578
We might pick up a few points,
but we lose by 3 or 4 percent.

675
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:47,082
Who fucking knows, governor?
But we can't take the chance.

676
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:48,458
What do you think?

677
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:51,211
I think we fold up the campaign
in Ohio, take a loss,

678
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:54,798
blame it on Republicans playing
games, head to North Carolina.

679
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,635
I can't run from Ohio. They'll kill us.
Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.

680
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,722
I'm not gonna do it. What does he want?
Head of the FDA or something?

681
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,032
Cabinet post.

682
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,477
- Yeah, what, labor?
- State.

683
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,231
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'm gonna give Secretary of State

684
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,692
to a guy who wants to cut
the top 10 floors off the U.N.?

685
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,821
Paul, when we started this campaign,
l said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals.

686
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,865
Governor, if you lose Ohio and they get
Thompson's delegates,

687
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:24,744
then they get North Carolina,
then they get the lead.

688
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,832
A lead you can't beat.
If we walk from Ohio,

689
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,167
take Thompson,
give him the fuckin' Cabinet post,

690
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,586
then we take North Carolina, his state,

691
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:37,340
then Pennsylvania, your state,
and then it's simple math, Mike.

692
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:42,220
Take his endorsement
and the race is over.

693
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,267
Paul, I respect you.

694
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,854
I respect your opinion.

695
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,773
I'm never gonna do it.

696
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,695
So I suggest we find a way
for me to win Ohio.

697
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,033
Anything else?

698
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,511
- It's not gonna cut it.
- Every car company in north of Ohio.

699
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:08,496
They've booked every
single van for Tuesday.

700
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,248
Fuck. Jess, I gotta call you back.

701
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:11,891
- All of them?
- All of them.

702
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,377
- You're killing me.
- Here's what I got so far.

703
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,213
Independents aren't biting,
but the Republicans are.

704
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,350
They're not gonna tell a pollster
they're voting Democratic.

705
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:22,620
- I can't find the goddamn polls.
- Alright, I also made a call and

706
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,886
I'm gonna get a hundred vans out of
Covington and Newport, Kentucky.

707
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,682
- We don't need the fucking vans.
- No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

708
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,311
- We don't want Pullman to have the vans.
- We were the underdog before we got into this.

709
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,438
And we continue to be the underdog.

710
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,141
Well, then...

711
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,376
Yeah, we always knew the numbers were
gonna get closer as it got to Tuesday.

712
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,153
We're not lowering expectations.

713
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:43,948
I mean, have I ever said to you
that we had Ohio locked?

714
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:46,993
Well then, at least, give me the courtesy
of printing that in your column.

715
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,124
What are you writing?

716
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:56,419
The greatest speech ever given
on hydrogen power.

717
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,755
The bar is set awfully high on that one.

718
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,882
Don't I know it.

719
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,137
I was hit up by Mitchell's wife
for you to show up

720
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:09,599
at her Daughters of
the American Revolution luncheon.

721
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,643
Who's Mitchell?

722
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,604
Congressman from the First District?

723
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,981
You might wanna remember that.

724
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:21,277
Fucking congressman. Could you
imagine doing this every two years?

725
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,530
No, I can't.

726
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,075
Let's just do it one more time. Mm-hm.

727
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,285
- In four more years.
- That's it.

728
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,120
It's a deal.

729
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,960
Do you think we'll lose Ohio?

730
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,130
I don't know.

731
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,718
If you took Thompson's delegates,
the race would be over.

732
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:48,137
Ohio wouldn't matter.

733
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,766
Is Paul working on you?

734
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:54,644
Stephen.

735
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,232
- They are good.
- Mm.

736
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,488
- Is Thompson so bad?
- He's a shit.

737
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,534
- Is he worse than Pullman?
- Yes, Stephen.

738
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:23,089
Every time I draw a line in the sand
and then I ... I move it.

739
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:27,468
Fundraisers, union deals,
I wasn't gonna do any of it.

740
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:29,637
Negative ads.

741
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,181
I can't on this one.

742
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:34,767
Not Thompson.

743
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,693
Tell Mrs. Mitchell
I'll make her goddamn luncheon.

744
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,196
Let the old ladies pat me on the head.

745
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:52,493
- You've got great hair.
- You too, baby.

746
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,039
- Gay marriage.
- It's a silly argument.

747
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,042
- Not to 50 percent of Americans.
- Over the age of 50.

748
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,669
That's who votes, that's
who shows up at the polls.

749
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:05,423
Well, that's changing. Hopefully, the
way we frame the argument is as well.

750
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:08,926
- From a religious...?
- From a religious to a civil-rights issue.

751
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:12,388
But one could argue a great difference
between gender and race.

752
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:16,142
Not really, we used to ban interracial
marriages. Women couldn't vote.

753
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,227
Paul, I have the guy from
Proctor & Gamble.

754
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,229
- Keep an eye on the governor.
- Okay.

755
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,857
- I gotta know what's going on.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

756
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:27,170
All right, wait, wait, wait.
She's got a point to make. Go ahead.

757
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,032
The argument is that men and women can
in fact be considered separate but equal.

758
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,409
- Races cannot.
- How so?

759
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,079
You have separate public bathrooms
for both men and women,

760
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,582
but it would be illegal to have
separate bathrooms for two races.

761
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,885
- Now.
- Yes, now.

762
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,270
That's what I'm saying.
See, we're framing the argument...

763
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,756
- What time is this thing airing?
- Nine o'clock.

764
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,342
- How'd we do?
- We did good.

765
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,476
Yes, I know, but I tried to reach him,
and I couldn't get through.

766
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,111
- Yeah, just e-mail it to me.
Just e-mail it to me.

767
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,029
- Yeah.
- Then I can give it to him.

768
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:13,282
Oh, good. So attach that
and send it as an e-mail to me.

769
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,917
Yeah, I missed my opportunity there.

770
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:28,131
- Now.
- Yes, now.

771
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,466
We're framing the argument on the idea

772
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,386
that you choose to be gay,

773
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:37,223
not that you were born that way,
like being born African-American.

774
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:39,642
If you start the discussion with the idea

775
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,521
that gay is not a life choice
but is actually part of your DNA,

776
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:47,984
then gay marriage can and must
only be a civil-rights issue.

777
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,987
That's what I believe.
That's where I stand.

778
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:55,742
Do you think your candor is your appeal?

779
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,035
Sorry.

780
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:02,623
Fuck. It's not you.

781
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:26,355
- Molly?
- Hello?

782
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,038
Hey, your phone rang.

783
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,040
- Hm?
- Your phone rang.

784
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:46,475
It did?

785
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:49,170
Who's calling you at 2:30 in the morning?

786
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:50,713
I don't know.

787
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,257
Really? Because he asked for you by name.

788
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:56,761
- You answered it?
- I thought it was my phone.

789
00:45:57,513 --> 00:45:59,222
Who is it?

790
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,516
I don't know.

791
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:04,894
Is it one of those interns
drunk-dialing you?

792
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,146
No, that never happens.

793
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:08,748
Let me see the number.

794
00:46:08,816 --> 00:46:10,107
- Oh, boy.
- Give me my...

795
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:11,901
- No. I'm calling him.
- Stephen, stop it.

796
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,237
- It's not funny.
- I'm saying I'm your dad.

797
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,572
Stephen it's not funny.
Give me my phone. Hang up.

798
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,408
- I have a shotgun.
- Stephen, hang up the phone.

799
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:41,347
Why is the governor calling you
at 2:30 in the morning?

800
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,769
Molly.

801
00:46:49,523 --> 00:46:51,774
Why is the governor calling you at all?

802
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,821
I'm in trouble.

803
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,075
With the governor?

804
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,912
What's going on?

805
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:11,961
I was working on the campaign in Iowa.

806
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:17,133
There was a party in Ben's room
after the rally.

807
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,304
There was a party with you
and Ben and the governor?

808
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:25,224
- No, he wasn't there.
- Where was he?

809
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:30,730
I took him up a hard copy
of the polling numbers.

810
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:33,649
After the party?

811
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,694
It was around midnight.

812
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:42,116
I just stood in the doorway with him,

813
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:45,870
just talking for a really long time.

814
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,002
He just reached behind me
and closed the door.

815
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:02,595
Jesus fucking Christ.

816
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,689
Were you drunk?

817
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,984
Not that drunk.

818
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:19,528
- How many times?
- It was just that once.

819
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,255
- Just the once?
- Just once.

820
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,905
- Does anybody know?
- No one knows.

821
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,308
- Does anybody see?
- No.

822
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,769
- How could you know?
- I know.

823
00:48:25,827 --> 00:48:27,828
Then why is he calling you right now?

824
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:29,830
I called him first.

825
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:34,627
- Why?
- Because I didn't know who else to go to.

826
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:37,296
And I needed 900 bucks.

827
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:41,709
For what?

828
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,512
I can't go to my dad.

829
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,810
We're Catholic.

830
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:02,613
So, what should I do?

831
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:05,741
Stephen?

832
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:31,494
What's up?

833
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,000
What's our limit on petty cash?

834
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:42,338
- It's about 500. Why?
- I need everything we can get.

835
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,465
Everything okay?

836
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:48,677
- Need help with anything?
- Yeah. Don't put it on the books.

837
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:50,879
That's all.

838
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,060
- What should I put it down as?
- Don't put it down as anything.

839
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:58,196
OK, anything over a 100 l gotta put down.

840
00:50:58,197 --> 00:50:59,863
Just do it!

841
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:03,651
Molly.

842
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:34,223
- Okay.
- I'll take it back.

843
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:41,730
That's all.

844
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,338
- Yes, Ida?
- Stevie, off the record...

845
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:09,592
No, I cannot tell you
what happened in North Carolina.

846
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,344
That's not what I wanted
to ask you about.

847
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:16,182
- Okay. What?
- You met with Duffy.

848
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,646
- Who told you that?
- A little bird.

849
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,275
- Who?
- Did you meet with him?

850
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,737
Where are you?

851
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:34,491
I know you met with him at a little bar in
Cincy just before the press conference.

852
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:37,369
- Duffy ordered buffalo wings.
- Who said that? Duffy?

853
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:39,788
Anonymous. What happened with Duffy?

854
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,570
Ida, you're supposed to be my friend.

855
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,641
Why you wanna stick the fuckin'
knife in me on a bullshit story?

856
00:52:43,652 --> 00:52:45,503
Well, is that what you thought,
that we're friends?

857
00:52:45,504 --> 00:52:47,354
I've given you everything
you ever wanted.

858
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:49,840
Everything. Every story, every scoop,
the entire profile on Paul.

859
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:52,051
You've given me a lot, but
let's get real here, Steve.

860
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:54,826
The only reason you've treated me
well was that I work for the Times,

861
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,826
not because I'm your friend.
You give me what I want,

862
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:59,597
I write you better stories.
Don't pretend it's any more than that.

863
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:01,310
Why'd you meet with Duffy?

864
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:04,271
Go fuck yourself. Okay, I'll make
it easier on you. Forget Duffy.

865
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:07,107
What happened at Paul
and Thompson's meeting?

866
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:11,237
Keep your voice down. Do you have
any idea what this could do to me?

867
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:13,739
Of course I do, that's why
I'm giving you a choice.

868
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:14,990
I could get fired.

869
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,910
So it's not a difficult one, is it?

870
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,995
I've gotta file by 3 p.m. tomorrow.

871
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,414
You've got till then
to make up your mind.

872
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,670
- You motherfucker.
- Excuse me?

873
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,047
- You leaked it.
- Leaked what?

874
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:32,174
Don't bullshit me, Tom.

875
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,802
Bullshit you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.

876
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,263
- I just spoke to Ida Horowitz.
- Yeah?

877
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,640
She's threatening to release the story.

878
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:43,018
- What fucking story?
- That we met. That we fucking met.

879
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,855
- How did she find out?
- Don't play dumb, Tom.

880
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:50,025
- You think I leaked it to her?
- Yeah. Who else?

881
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,529
- I didn't leak it to her, Steve.
- Well, I know I didn't, so that leaves you.

882
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,322
Okay. Well, what does
she know?

883
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,783
She knows whatever you told her.

884
00:53:57,951 --> 00:54:00,202
I swear to Jesus
I did not leak it to her, Steve.

885
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,454
I don't want this story out
any more than you do.

886
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:06,166
- Well, too late.
- What did she tell you?

887
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:08,836
She knows where we met,
she knows when we met,

888
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:11,422
she knows you had fucking buffalo wings.

889
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:13,841
- She has a source?
- Yeah, she has a source.

890
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,884
And you have no idea who it could be?

891
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,377
Yeah, you.

892
00:54:18,663 --> 00:54:22,825
Well, for the record, it wasn't me, and
I didn't have fucking buffalo wings.

893
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,518
So it's gotta be someone else.

894
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:26,854
- Did you tell anyone?
- No. Did you?

895
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,690
- No.
- Did you admit to meeting with me?

896
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:31,984
- No.
- All right.

897
00:54:32,152 --> 00:54:35,195
Then we stonewall her
and she's got nothing.

898
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:39,199
She's gonna take the story to Drudge
or to Roll Call or some shit like that.

899
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:40,509
You can't stop her?

900
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:44,038
She's trying to blackmail me.
She wants info about Thompson.

901
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:46,915
Well, then tell her what
she wants to know.

902
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,209
l can't do that.

903
00:54:49,377 --> 00:54:52,421
- You can't let this story get out.
- I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.

904
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,840
You don't have much choice here, Steve.

905
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:58,594
If I tell her about Thompson, I'm gonna
have to tell her that he's endorsing you.

906
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:02,348
Then tell her. I can handle it from
my side if I start getting calls.

907
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:03,657
No fucking way.

908
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:07,569
Paul told her we had Thompson in a bag.
It's gonna make him look like a fuckin' fool.

909
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,390
He's gonna look like a fuckin' fool anyway
when Thompson endorses us.

910
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,272
I can't do it.

911
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,325
You know, you're on a sinking ship, Steve.

912
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:23,619
Tell her what she wants to know and jump.

913
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,747
Come over to our side.
We can control this thing.

914
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:30,167
- Steve?
- I gotta go.

915
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,479
I'm up here.

916
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,858
You scared the shit out of me.

917
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:01,323
Here.

918
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:05,035
It's almost 1800 bucks.

919
00:56:05,203 --> 00:56:10,082
You gotta make the appointment now,
like today, from a pay phone.

920
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,544
I'll take you to the clinic
and I'll pick you up, but no one else.

921
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:15,546
You understand?

922
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,631
Yeah.

923
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:22,010
Take the rest of the money
and buy yourself a ticket home.

924
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,012
Can't be here anymore.
We can't afford it.

925
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,391
Not with everything that's gonna
happen in the next week.

926
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,520
And this situation, just can't be here.

927
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:37,526
- You mean I can't be here.
- Right.

928
00:56:38,736 --> 00:56:41,363
Stephen, I wouldn't tell anyone.

929
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,241
I hope not.

930
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:46,118
Then why?

931
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,954
Because you fucked up.

932
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:51,957
- He and I both fucked up.
- That's true.

933
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:54,773
But I have a responsibility to
him and, more importantly,

934
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:57,020
I have a responsibility to this campaign.

935
00:56:57,088 --> 00:56:59,047
I could go to North Carolina
and work on the campaign.

936
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:03,385
Molly, you gotta wake the fuck up.
This is the big leagues. It's mean.

937
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,014
When you make a mistake,
you lose the right to play.

938
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:09,558
Make the appointment.

939
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,144
Tell me when and where we have to go.

940
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,734
Listen to this.
I got the placement in the Times.

941
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,029
Bumped like 600 fucking articles.
Tom Duffy, 2008:

942
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:24,740
"This is a match-up
between hope vs. fear."

943
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,577
Nine times out of 10, the fear candidate
tends to be most experienced.

944
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:32,414
But in our presidential races, the least-
experienced candidate almost always wins.

945
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,751
JFK vs. Nixon. Carter vs. Ford.
Bush vs. Gore.

946
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,754
"I like our chances with
the new kid on the block."

947
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,131
End quote.
Thomas fucking Duffy.

948
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:43,717
He's gotta be having a stroke right now.

949
00:59:08,303 --> 00:59:11,179
So just call me when you can leave, okay?

950
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:20,522
I hate this shit.

951
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:25,777
I'm gonna come back,
and this is all gonna be over.

952
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:27,529
Yeah.

953
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,839
Absolutely. There's no question about it.

954
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,677
Yeah, but we gotta think
broader strokes here.

955
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:52,929
Just rethink everything.

956
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:57,559
Uh... Well, yeah,
I know how to handle it.

957
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:02,814
Um, look, Stevie just got here.
Can I call you back in a few minutes?

958
01:00:02,982 --> 01:00:06,026
Okay, bye.
Ahem. The governor.

959
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:08,570
We had a good long talk on the way back.

960
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,073
He's up to speed with everything.

961
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,116
How'd he take it?

962
01:00:14,535 --> 01:00:16,161
Better than I thought he would.

963
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,997
Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.

964
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,543
Paul I gotta tell you something
I don't know how to tell you.

965
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:25,170
What's up?

966
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:29,174
Ida knows that I met with Duffy.

967
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,641
I don't know how she knows,
but she knows.

968
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:40,686
And she tried to blackmail me.

969
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:47,150
She said she's gonna release the story
unless I tell her all the details

970
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:49,569
about your meeting with Thompson.

971
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:56,576
So it's gonna hit the papers.

972
01:00:56,744 --> 01:00:58,453
Probably.

973
01:00:59,714 --> 01:01:03,225
And whoever she takes it to is
gonna call me for a statement.

974
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,087
If I deny the whole thing altogether,
but Duffy admits to it,

975
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:08,554
it's gonna look even worse.

976
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:12,400
And if I just say, "No comment,"
they're not gonna let up.

977
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,721
I leaked it to Ida.

978
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,980
At the event.

979
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,987
- I don't understand.
- We made a deal.

980
01:01:36,075 --> 01:01:38,326
Paul, they're gonna...

981
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,997
They're gonna print that story
in the paper tomorrow morning.

982
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,665
I know.

983
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,668
So why'd you do it?
Why would you do that?

984
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,837
Why would you do that to the campaign?

985
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,506
The campaign will survive.

986
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:58,638
- Why would you do that to me?
- Makes it easier to let you go.

987
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,767
What?

988
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:04,102
Why'd you meet with Duffy?

989
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:11,985
I made a mistake.
I made a stupid mistake.

990
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:15,238
No Stephen, you didn't make a mistake,
you made a choice.

991
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:18,575
You called me and left a message
to call you back, that was important.

992
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:20,702
And when I did, you told
me to forget about it.

993
01:02:21,245 --> 01:02:24,039
You chose not to tell me.
Why'd you make that choice?

994
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,349
Because, Paul, I didn't
think it was important.

995
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:28,043
Oh, fuck yes, you did.

996
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:32,977
But you went because you were curious,

997
01:02:32,978 --> 01:02:35,892
because you felt flattered,
because you felt special...

998
01:02:36,344 --> 01:02:39,387
to think that Duffy wanted
to speak to you instead of me.

999
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:43,366
Because you thought to yourself
"Maybe I can get something out of this."

1000
01:02:43,434 --> 01:02:46,027
Because.. because it made you feel big.

1001
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:54,486
You know, the first campaign I ran,
it was a tiny little race in Kentucky.

1002
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:55,837
Hm... State Senate seat,

1003
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:59,574
working for some redneck nobody
named Sam McGuthrie.

1004
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,328
No staff, no money, no fucking office.

1005
01:03:03,496 --> 01:03:05,664
Everyone thought we
didn't stand a chance.

1006
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:08,333
No way we can compete, right?
And about this time,

1007
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:11,503
this guy running this congressional
campaign a few districts over

1008
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:14,080
gives me a call, and
he says, "I really like

1009
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:18,443
what you're able to do for poor old Sam,
but, let's face it, he's a goner.

1010
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:22,097
Why don't you come work
for me?" What did I do?

1011
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,016
Well, Stephen, this is where
you and I are different.

1012
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:28,061
I told Sam about the call.
And Sam says to me,

1013
01:03:28,229 --> 01:03:31,459
"Paul, if you think this other guy's
got a chance at winning and"

1014
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:33,503
"he can pay you more than
anything I can afford

1015
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:37,049
"and if it's what you feel you need to do,
then I won't get in your way."

1016
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:40,031
And I say, "Sam, you took a chance on me"

1017
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,451
"and hired me when I was even
more of a nobody than you are."

1018
01:03:44,745 --> 01:03:48,915
"So I'll be damned if I'm gonna jump ship
just because the shit hits the fan."

1019
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,545
We lost that race, but three years later
when Sam decided to run for governor,

1020
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:55,672
who do you think he called?

1021
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,176
We won that race, and 20 years later
I am where I am fucking now.

1022
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:04,306
Now, there's only one thing I value
in this world, Stephen, and that's loyalty.

1023
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,976
And without it, you're nothing!
And you have no one.

1024
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,481
And in politics, in fucking politics,

1025
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,568
it's the only currency you can count on.

1026
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,195
That's why I'm letting you go.

1027
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,240
Not because you're not good enough,
not because I don't like you.

1028
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:25,994
But I value trust over skill, and
I don't fucking trust you anymore.

1029
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:30,206
It doesn't matter whether you trust me, Paul.
It matters whether the governor does.

1030
01:04:30,374 --> 01:04:34,085
The governor already knows, and he
thinks it's the right thing to do.

1031
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,633
- He does?
- Yeah, and you know what?

1032
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,177
If I were you, I'd get
a good night's sleep,

1033
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,431
because you're gonna get fucking pounded
by calls from the press in the morning.

1034
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,989
- Hey.
- Hey. Where were you today?

1035
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:29,117
Um, I'm not feeling great today, Ben.

1036
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:33,288
You picked a hell of a day
to call in sick.

1037
01:06:34,498 --> 01:06:37,876
- Jesus, it was a fucking wild-ass day.
- Why? What happened?

1038
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:40,086
Stephen's off the campaign.

1039
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:43,173
Paul fired him.
Some fucking setup about loyalty.

1040
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,451
And looks like Stephen may have been doubling
down with Duffy, on the Pullman campaign.

1041
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:49,605
I... I was sitting in the room when
Paul told Stephen he was fired.

1042
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,640
And Stephen said, "Who's gonna
take over?" And Paul said me.

1043
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,101
I know, and I'm like,
"Easy there, soldier."

1044
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:57,979
And then Stephen goes apeshit, Paul
gives him this speech about loyalty.

1045
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,107
and then shits out Stephen like
I've never seen before. I mean...

1046
01:07:01,275 --> 01:07:04,194
- humiliating shit.
- When was this?

1047
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:06,279
Molly, listen to me.

1048
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,490
I'm gonna run the campaign under Paul.

1049
01:07:09,033 --> 01:07:12,077
Stephen's going to Duffy.
I just jumped three years ahead.

1050
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,664
So starting tomorrow morning,
we go into full damage control.

1051
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,667
And I'm telling you,
Stephen's going apeshit.

1052
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:23,755
He said he's taking everybody down
on his way out. Morris, everybody.

1053
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,176
Shit. I gotta take this.
Do you need anything?

1054
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,761
No.

1055
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:33,515
Paul. What's up?
I'm mailing you all those files.

1056
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,121
- Where's Duffy?
- You got an appointment?

1057
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,926
Joe, can we have the room for a minute?

1058
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:11,970
Okay. Thank you.

1059
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:15,640
It's not too bright
walking in here like that, Steve.

1060
01:08:20,437 --> 01:08:22,021
I'm in.

1061
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,901
I'm coming to work for you. A reporter
from Roll Call phoned me this afternoon.

1062
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,361
Yeah. I know who leaked it.

1063
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:30,321
- Who?
- Paul.

1064
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:31,698
You told Paul?

1065
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:35,160
- I told Paul, and he leaked it.
- Oh, Steve.

1066
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:38,288
- You shouldn't have told him that.
- I felt like I should.

1067
01:08:38,455 --> 01:08:40,874
Yeah. I've worked with Paul.
He gets paranoid.

1068
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:43,001
- Obviously.
- So he fired you.

1069
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:45,628
- I quit.
- No, you're lying to me. Come on man.

1070
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:48,256
I quit. I'm gonna give you everything.

1071
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,842
I'm gonna give you Morris,
I'm gonna give you his whole strategy...

1072
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,263
I don't need his strategy. I already have it.
Paul gave it all to Thompson.

1073
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,557
What if I had something else?

1074
01:08:57,725 --> 01:08:59,767
You would do that to Morris? To Paul?

1075
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,269
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

1076
01:09:02,021 --> 01:09:03,938
Revenge makes people unpredictable.

1077
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:06,774
Steve, I can't have someone who's
unpredictable, who's unstable.

1078
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,194
- I'm not unstable.
- You know, if this had been a clean break,

1079
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:12,080
if you had left Morris
before the story broke,

1080
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,065
that'd be one thing that we could control.

1081
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:15,967
But like this?

1082
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:18,745
Paul fires you, and then you
wanna come work for me?

1083
01:09:18,913 --> 01:09:21,164
It makes me look like
I'm picking up the scraps.

1084
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:24,375
It puts Morris in the driver's seat.
I can't have that.

1085
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:28,129
- What if I had something big?
- Like what?

1086
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:33,760
Something big.

1087
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,888
Something that'll put Morris down.

1088
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:39,766
What is it?

1089
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,311
Give me the job.

1090
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:50,610
No, that's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

1091
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,614
Go take a nice long vacation.
You're a smart guy.

1092
01:09:54,782 --> 01:09:57,825
Everything that I said
the other day is absolutely true.

1093
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,496
But, you know,
maybe politics isn't for you.

1094
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,998
Politics is my life.

1095
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:08,711
Oh, you know what? Do yourself a favor.
Get out, now, while you still can.

1096
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:11,005
Go into entertainment or business.

1097
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,342
Go open a fucking restaurant
in Costa Rica. Anything.

1098
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,845
Do something that's gonna
make you happy, okay?

1099
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,106
Because if you stay in this
business long enough,

1100
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:20,665
you're gonna get jaded and cynical.

1101
01:10:20,732 --> 01:10:23,885
- Like you.
- Yeah, just like me.

1102
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:27,772
You knew I was gonna
fucking tell Paul, didn't you?

1103
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:32,360
No, I didn't know. I thought
you might, but I didn't know.

1104
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,947
You knew I was gonna tell him, and you
knew he was gonna fucking fire me.

1105
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:38,658
Well that's the thing about Paul.
He's big on loyalty.

1106
01:10:38,826 --> 01:10:41,536
Yeah, I know.
I just got a big speech on it.

1107
01:10:43,956 --> 01:10:45,623
You were never gonna hire me.

1108
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,252
Put yourself in my shoes, Steve.

1109
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,298
Your opponent has the best media mind
in the country working for his team.

1110
01:10:53,465 --> 01:10:54,841
What are you gonna do?

1111
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,304
You're either gonna hire him for
yourself, or you're gonna work it

1112
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:02,598
so if you can't have him,
the other team can't either.

1113
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:06,394
This is a win-win situation for me.

1114
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,523
And you come work for me, great.
Paul doesn't have you.

1115
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:13,484
Then again, Paul fires you,
I don't want you, fine.

1116
01:11:13,652 --> 01:11:15,695
Paul still doesn't have you.

1117
01:11:16,196 --> 01:11:18,156
Either way, I win.

1118
01:11:18,657 --> 01:11:21,576
And the moment l got you
to sit down in that chair...

1119
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:25,246
- I knew I'd won.
- This is...

1120
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,207
It's my life that you're talking about.

1121
01:11:28,275 --> 01:11:30,981
It doesn't make me happy
doing this kind of things.

1122
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:33,387
Don't think it gives me any pleasure.

1123
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,933
No, I'm sorry for you. I really am.

1124
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,928
Take care of yourself.

1125
01:12:12,336 --> 01:12:14,212
The third floor. I'm coming to you.

1126
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,517
Nothing.

1127
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,397
No. No, ma'am. She's not breathing.

1128
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:36,317
I don't know. Fifteen minutes.

1129
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,455
Do you know her?

1130
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,087
She's gone.

1131
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,549
I'm sorry, what?

1132
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,843
Oh, yes, now, I can hear them now.

1133
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:07,140
We're on the third floor.

1134
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:09,517
Yes.

1135
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:13,437
Yes, ma'am.

1136
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:55,813
Um...

1137
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:58,983
Where are you?
It's, uh, it's 4-something.

1138
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:01,861
and they're gonna close up
in a few minutes.

1139
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,824
Stephen, it's Ben.
Uh, listen, what the fuck?

1140
01:14:06,992 --> 01:14:08,910
Jesus, um. What are you gonna do?

1141
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:16,083
Stephen, um, I just heard from Ben.

1142
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,294
Please don't do anything fucked up.

1143
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:20,963
Goddamn it, you motherfucker,
pick up the phone.

1144
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:22,840
Don't do this.

1145
01:14:26,887 --> 01:14:29,180
I'm not going away.

1146
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:38,707
The coroner stated that
based on the evidence found

1147
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,810
by the police in that hotel room,
that this was an accidental overdose,

1148
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,362
a lethal cocktail of alcohol
and prescription drugs.

1149
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,949
Cincinnati's police Chief Darryl Matthews
has called for a full investigation

1150
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,744
pending a toxicology report,
which could take up to two weeks.

1151
01:14:51,912 --> 01:14:53,913
Just a terrible, terrible situation

1152
01:14:54,081 --> 01:14:57,667
for the former senator,
now DNC chairman, Jack Stearns

1153
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,627
and his family.

1154
01:15:22,609 --> 01:15:24,652
I want on the ticket.

1155
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,990
You need me on that ticket,
and you could use my delegates.

1156
01:15:30,909 --> 01:15:32,827
And you need them before Tuesday.

1157
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,997
Make a fine story on
the Sunday-morning news cycle.

1158
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,667
So I expect to hear from you
by noon tomorrow

1159
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,004
or I endorse Pullman
and take that Cabinet seat.

1160
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,347
Anything else you wanna
talk about, Stephen?

1161
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,743
- The entire staff is...
- We're in a state of shock.

1162
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:18,122
We send our condolences to Jack and
Joanna Stearns and their entire family.

1163
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,249
Of course, our hearts go out to them.

1164
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:23,210
It's hard to imagine
what they must be going through.

1165
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:28,382
What we know right now is that
it appears to have been a drug...

1166
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,427
An accidental prescription overdose.

1167
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:34,555
- Ida?
- Is suicide ruled out?

1168
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,816
We have no reason to believe...

1169
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,048
I don't think we have any information yet,

1170
01:16:39,049 --> 01:16:41,412
but obviously there will
be a full investigation.

1171
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,981
We just wanted to say
that our hearts go out,

1172
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:47,401
our prayers go out, to the entire family.

1173
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,655
She really is...
She was part of our family.

1174
01:16:50,822 --> 01:16:52,657
Yeah. Did you know her well?

1175
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:54,450
Not well, but I did know her.

1176
01:16:54,618 --> 01:16:57,119
And what I saw was
a hard-working young woman

1177
01:16:57,287 --> 01:16:59,914
with a great spirit.

1178
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:04,126
It's just a sad day for the campaign.

1179
01:17:04,294 --> 01:17:06,837
And it's a sad day for
those of us who know Jack.

1180
01:17:07,005 --> 01:17:09,590
Governor, how long has
she interned for you?

1181
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:13,135
Uh... You wanna...?
Yeah.

1182
01:17:15,722 --> 01:17:18,516
She had only been on the road
with us for a few weeks.

1183
01:17:18,684 --> 01:17:21,769
Maybe four weeks, I think. I can check.

1184
01:17:22,062 --> 01:17:26,232
Will you be continuing
with your schedule today?

1185
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,734
Yes, we will most certainly
stay on schedule.

1186
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:58,783
Seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about.

1187
01:19:01,411 --> 01:19:03,370
Does it seem that way?

1188
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,419
If you have something...

1189
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:12,479
if you think you have something you wanna
get off your chest, then why don't you?

1190
01:19:12,672 --> 01:19:15,800
How about I do the talking
and you do the listening?

1191
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,512
Okay.

1192
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:23,390
As of tomorrow, there's gonna be
a few changes to your campaign.

1193
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:27,228
Paul's out. I'm your
senior campaign manager.

1194
01:19:27,938 --> 01:19:29,939
I'll draft a statement.

1195
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:33,359
"The campaign got to a point
where we needed to make changes."

1196
01:19:33,527 --> 01:19:36,737
- You can put your own words in there.
- Why would I do that?

1197
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:38,948
Because you wanna win.

1198
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:42,076
Because you broke
the only rule in politics.

1199
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,036
You wanna be president?

1200
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:47,081
You can start a war,
you can lie, you can cheat,

1201
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:51,919
you can bankrupt the country,
but you can't fuck the interns.

1202
01:19:52,963 --> 01:19:55,047
They'll get you for that.

1203
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,385
What do you think you have, Stephen?

1204
01:19:59,553 --> 01:20:03,430
- A troubled young girl tells you a story.
- A troubled young pregnant girl

1205
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,767
- Is that what she told you?
- who needed cash for an abortion.

1206
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,260
What did you do? You give her money?

1207
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:11,475
Maybe she needed cash and you were
the perfect guy to hit up.

1208
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,233
- Is that your best play?
- You need a job that bad, Stephen?

1209
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:17,611
You come in here with your dick
in your hand? You got nothing.

1210
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:19,530
Then how did I get in here?

1211
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:24,201
You're right, Mike, there's nothing.
There's no voice messages, no texts,

1212
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:26,453
no e-mails, no pictures, no tape.

1213
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:29,164
And yet I'm standing right here.

1214
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:31,834
Yeah, well go home.

1215
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,961
She left a note.

1216
01:20:42,762 --> 01:20:46,307
- How would you know that?
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1217
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:49,810
I took her phone, and I found a note.

1218
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,313
- I thought it was an accident.
- I don't know Mike.

1219
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,816
You're gonna have to tell me.
You're the last person she called.

1220
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,613
Note says she's pregnant,
got an abortion,

1221
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,115
and doesn't wanna hurt you.

1222
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:06,410
Then why would she leave a note
that could only do that?

1223
01:21:06,578 --> 01:21:08,120
Because she's 20.

1224
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:15,544
- What do you want?
- Paul's gone. Today.

1225
01:21:15,712 --> 01:21:18,756
I set a meeting with you and Thompson,
and You promise him the ticket.

1226
01:21:18,924 --> 01:21:22,676
You get 356 pledged delegates,
you get North Carolina,

1227
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,094
you take office,

1228
01:21:24,262 --> 01:21:27,056
and you make right what
so many people have made wrong.

1229
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:30,684
- All the things we both believe in.
- Well, I don't believe in extortion.

1230
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,771
I don't believe in tying myself
to you for the next eight years.

1231
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:36,649
Four years.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1232
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:39,693
Huh.

1233
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:46,325
What were you doing in her room?

1234
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:48,702
Housekeeping, before you made Page 1.

1235
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,081
No, you were fired, you were out.
What were you doing in her room?

1236
01:21:52,248 --> 01:21:54,041
I was fixing a situation.

1237
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,711
I got a call, Someone from the hotel
thought I could help and called.

1238
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,546
So you were off the campaign,

1239
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:03,592
but you thought it was important
to fix things?

1240
01:22:08,598 --> 01:22:11,308
It was your voice
the other night on the phone.

1241
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:14,728
You were fucking her.

1242
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,231
What'd you do, Stephen?

1243
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:24,071
- I lent her money and gave her a ride.
- I bet you did.

1244
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,032
There's no note.

1245
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,743
- Okay Mike, there's no note.
- Show it to me.

1246
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,246
You think I brought it here?

1247
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,581
That's how people get hurt.

1248
01:22:42,382 --> 01:22:44,675
Okay, let's play this out.

1249
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:49,847
You're not wearing a wire, because
everything you suggested is illegal.

1250
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:52,599
And you wouldn't fare too well
in federal prison.

1251
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,854
You were fucking her,
and she told you about her situation.

1252
01:22:57,022 --> 01:22:59,690
There are no records or conversations
between the two of us,

1253
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:03,027
and since she's had an abortion,
there's no DNA evidence.

1254
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:06,113
So if there's no note...

1255
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:09,783
then it's your word against mine.

1256
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:13,328
Your word.

1257
01:23:13,496 --> 01:23:17,458
A fired, disgruntled employee.

1258
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,710
Or a sitting governor.

1259
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:26,341
There's no note.

1260
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,805
It's your call, governor.

1261
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:26,276
- Paul, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

1262
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:25,294
How much could a big shake-up like this,

1263
01:25:25,461 --> 01:25:28,005
days before the Ohio primary,
hurt a campaign?

1264
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:31,717
l asked Paul Zara how his firing
could actually help the candidate.

1265
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:35,470
The governor and I felt that
in light of these changing numbers

1266
01:25:35,638 --> 01:25:38,432
that it was best to put
a new face on the campaign.

1267
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,768
Stephen is very talented, uh, very smart.

1268
01:25:55,491 --> 01:26:00,579
You always hear people talk
about events out of sequence,

1269
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:02,623
the order of things.

1270
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,589
There is no greater grief

1271
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,801
than a parent laying their child to rest.

1272
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:23,143
She was a little girl trying to make it
in a very grown-up world.

1273
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:26,605
A world where every mistake is magnified.

1274
01:26:26,773 --> 01:26:31,485
And she was smart and pretty
and so, so young.

1275
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,367
Father, you ask us to accept God's plan,

1276
01:26:38,534 --> 01:26:41,161
to not question his judgment.

1277
01:26:41,704 --> 01:26:46,333
With all due respect,
I don't accept this judgment.

1278
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,002
She made the world better.

1279
01:26:51,464 --> 01:26:53,465
Not just for me,

1280
01:26:54,926 --> 01:26:57,511
but for everyone she touched.

1281
01:27:10,483 --> 01:27:13,110
You should hire Jack for a speechwriter.

1282
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,737
I'll keep it in mind.

1283
01:27:17,949 --> 01:27:22,035
- You come here to see me?
- No. Friend of the family.

1284
01:27:22,662 --> 01:27:24,871
Got her the internship.

1285
01:27:25,915 --> 01:27:27,708
I've known her since she was born.

1286
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:30,919
I'm sorry.

1287
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:36,133
Governor couldn't make the flight?

1288
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,303
He's meeting with Thompson.

1289
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,513
Look at you.

1290
01:27:41,681 --> 01:27:43,682
All grown up with tits and all.

1291
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:47,811
I learned from the best.

1292
01:27:51,858 --> 01:27:55,277
Well, one day we'll grab a beer,
and you can tell me

1293
01:27:55,445 --> 01:27:58,113
what you had on the governor
that put me out.

1294
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,116
How do you know I didn't
have something on you?

1295
01:28:08,041 --> 01:28:09,458
Well, you better get going.

1296
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:12,586
You have a campaign to run,
I've got offices to look at.

1297
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,546
Farragut North?

1298
01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:18,759
Nice consultant firm
right off of K Street.

1299
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:21,261
Million a year.

1300
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:24,264
No one to fuck you over.

1301
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,267
- Sounds relaxing.
- Doesn't it?

1302
01:28:32,565 --> 01:28:35,442
The right man to lead
this great nation of ours

1303
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,444
in these challenging times,

1304
01:28:39,405 --> 01:28:43,784
and the next president of
the United States of America,

1305
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,243
Governor Mike Morris.

1306
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,789
We like Mike!

1307
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:55,962
And let me ask one very important thing.

1308
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:59,633
That all of us stand shoulder
to shoulder, arm in arm,

1309
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,927
in a united Democratic Party.

1310
01:29:04,055 --> 01:29:09,059
So I strongly urge
the 356 loyal delegates

1311
01:29:09,227 --> 01:29:11,561
that I have carried as a badge of honor

1312
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:13,730
throw their support to the governor.

1313
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:15,899
Let's put this primary behind us

1314
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:19,194
and get on with the business
of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

1315
01:29:19,362 --> 01:29:20,821
Thank you, God bless you,

1316
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,824
and God bless
the United States of America.

1317
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:25,951
Governor Mike Morris,
ladies and gentlemen.

1318
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:37,295
Senator Thompson, thank you.

1319
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:39,965
All right, Mr. President!

1320
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:43,927
Well, the polls aren't quite closed,
but I congratulate Senator Pullman

1321
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:47,973
and his Republican constituents
on their win here in Ohio.

1322
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:58,692
Senator Thompson, I am honored
to stand here with you today.

1323
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:03,196
And I am humbled by your kind words.
Thank you.

1324
01:30:03,973 --> 01:30:05,554
Ladies and gentlemen,

1325
01:30:05,555 --> 01:30:09,035
today marks the beginning of a
fight between two sets of ideals.

1326
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,609
Either we're gonna move forward,
or we're going to live in the past.

1327
01:30:13,175 --> 01:30:16,560
Either we're going to lead
the world again in technology

1328
01:30:16,627 --> 01:30:20,380
or we are going to bury
our heads in the sand.

1329
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:24,676
The sands of Saudi Arabia,
the sands of Iraq.

1330
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,598
Either we're going to let
greed and corruption

1331
01:30:29,765 --> 01:30:32,392
ruin our industries and our shorelines

1332
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,437
or we are going to take back our country.

1333
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:40,233
We are not a nation
used to coming in second

1334
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,068
or third.

1335
01:30:42,695 --> 01:30:45,822
- No, it's not decisive.
- We still have several contests to go.

1336
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,241
Those states are gonna
wanna have their say.

1337
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,285
It looks like we're gonna win Ohio.

1338
01:30:50,453 --> 01:30:53,580
You must concede, sir,
that these 356 delegates

1339
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:55,916
put the pledged delegates out of reach.

1340
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,752
The superdelegates are breaking
3 to 1 for Morris...

1341
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,506
We still have several contests to go,
and Ohio was a big win for us.

1342
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:04,090
Then do you have the funds?

1343
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:07,219
Of course we have the funds.
We get new donations daily.

1344
01:31:08,513 --> 01:31:10,680
- Hey, Ben?
- Yep?

1345
01:31:10,848 --> 01:31:14,226
- I was told to talk to you.
- I'm supposed to get a phone.

1346
01:31:14,393 --> 01:31:17,187
- And you are...?
- Jill Morris.

1347
01:31:17,355 --> 01:31:19,147
No relation.

1348
01:31:19,315 --> 01:31:22,526
- You a Bearcat, Jill Morris?
- No, I'm from Columbus.

1349
01:31:22,693 --> 01:31:24,444
I'm a Buckeye.

1350
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:42,087
You're making me look bad.

1351
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,589
- How so?
- I filed the story that said

1352
01:31:44,757 --> 01:31:48,134
you're off the campaign and
Thompson's going to Pullman.

1353
01:31:48,594 --> 01:31:50,262
Can't believe everything you read.

1354
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,558
Wanna give you an opportunity
to comment on my next story.

1355
01:31:54,725 --> 01:31:56,351
It says you delivered Thompson.

1356
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:59,479
You got the 356 delegates,
you delivered the nomination.

1357
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:01,690
And all you asked in return
was Paul's job.

1358
01:32:01,857 --> 01:32:04,943
Any chance of you confirming?
No press behind this point. She's press.

1359
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:08,530
I'll read about it in the funny papers.
Come on, Stephen.

1360
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:10,657
Aren't we friends anymore?

1361
01:32:13,077 --> 01:32:15,120
You're my best friend, Ida.

1362
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,644
- Jay, this is Sean in New York.
- Can you get him to run a mike check?

1363
01:33:25,024 --> 01:33:26,733
If you could count to 10 for me.

1364
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,861
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1365
01:33:30,029 --> 01:33:32,405
Good. Okay.

1366
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:47,587
Senator Thompson, I am proud

1367
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:50,757
that you have brought integrity
back to this election.

1368
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:53,510
Because that's what this comes out,
integrity.

1369
01:33:53,678 --> 01:33:55,595
- Stand by.
- Who we are.

1370
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:58,723
Because how we project ourselves
to the world matters.

1371
01:33:58,891 --> 01:34:01,226
Dignity matters. Integrity matters.

1372
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,271
Our future depends on it.

1373
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,985
Morris! Morris! Morris!

1374
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:20,328
We have now Governor Morris'
new senior campaign adviser,

1375
01:34:20,496 --> 01:34:23,456
Stephen Meyers, coming to us
from Xavier University

1376
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,126
where Senator Thompson
has just endorsed Governor Morris,

1377
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,837
essentially ending this primary race.

1378
01:34:29,004 --> 01:34:31,089
Stephen, can you give us some insight

1379
01:34:31,257 --> 01:34:33,591
into how this whole thing unfolded?
